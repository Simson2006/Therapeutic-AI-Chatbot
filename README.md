# Therapist Chatbot

A conversational AI chatbot designed to provide helpful, empathetic, and context-aware responses. The chatbot is trained on therapist-style data and uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques combined with deep learning to understand user queries and provide appropriate responses.

## üìù Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a simple AI chatbot that can interact with users like a virtual therapist or answer college-related questions. The main steps involved are:

1. **Data Preparation**:  
   - The chatbot is trained on datasets:
     - `intent.json` ‚Üí Therapy-related conversations
     - `intents.json` ‚Üí College-related questions and intents

2. **Text Preprocessing**:  
   - Clean and prepare text data:
     - Tokenization (splitting sentences into words)
     - Removing stopwords
     - Normalization (lowercasing, removing punctuation)

3. **Converting Words to Vectors**:  
   - Text data is converted into numerical vectors using **TF-IDF, CountVectorizer, or Word2Vec**.  
   - Vectorization allows the deep learning model to understand and learn patterns from the text.

4. **Model Training**:  
   - A deep learning model (`model_dl.h5`) is trained using the processed dataset.
   - `chatbot_model_training.ipynb` notebook is used for creating and training this model.

5. **Response Generation**:  
   - Once the model predicts the intent of a user query, the chatbot selects an appropriate response from the dataset.

6. **Web Interface (Streamlit)**:  
   - `app.py` contains the **Streamlit app** for the chatbot interface.
   - Users can type questions, and the chatbot responds instantly in the browser.

7. **Preprocessing New Queries**:  
   - `preprocess.py` module processes new text entered by the user:
     - Tokenizes and cleans the input
     - Converts words to vectors using the saved vectorizer
     - Prepares data for the model to predict the intent
